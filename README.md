# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This extends the boilerplate for freeCodeCampe's Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. This project calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 Numpy array, given as a list of 9 digits. Calculations are made by transforming the list into a 3x3 Numpy array, and are applied along both axes, as well as to the overall array. Results are returned as a dictionary with list values. This project was completed as part of freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python course.
